   - ✅ User registration & login with JWT
   - ✅ Secure password hashing
   - ✅ Movie CRUD operations
   - ✅ User statistics
   - ✅ Rate limiting & security
   - ✅ Input validation
   - ✅ Error handling

### 2. **API Integration Layer**
   - ✅ Created `frontend/js/api.js` for backend communication
   - ✅ Ready to connect with backend

### 3. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Complete setup guide (SETUP_GUIDE.md)
   - ✅ Backend API docs (backend/README.md)

---

## 🚀 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (Super Easy!):

### Step 1: Check if Node.js is Installed

Open PowerShell and type:
```powershell
node --version
```

**If you see a version number (like v18.x.x):** ✅ Great! Go to Step 2.

**If you get an error:** Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (get the LTS version)

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Database

**OPTION A: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud - Recommended & FREE)**
1. Go to: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2. Sign up (takes 2 minutes)
3. Create a free cluster
4. Click "Connect" → "Connect your application"
5. Copy the connection string (save it for next step)

**OPTION B: Install MongoDB Locally**
1. Download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
2. Install with default settings
3. Done!

---

### Step 3: Setup Backend (5 Minutes)

Open PowerShell in your project folder:

```powershell
# Go to backend folder
cd backend

# Install all dependencies (takes 1-2 minutes)
npm install

# Create your environment configuration file
copy .env.example .env

# Open the .env file to edit it
notepad .env
```

**In the `.env` file, change these lines:**

If using MongoDB Atlas (cloud):
```
MONGODB_URI=paste_your_connection_string_here
JWT_SECRET=change_this_to_any_random_text_12345
```

If using local MongoDB:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/movietrack
JWT_SECRET=change_this_to_any_random_text_12345
```

**Save and close the file.**

---

### Step 4: Start the Backend

In PowerShell (still in backend folder):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

**You should see:**
```
✅ MongoDB Connected Successfully
🚀 Server running on port 5000
```

🎉 **Backend is running!** Keep this window open.

---

### Step 5: Open the Frontend

Open a NEW PowerShell window:

```powershell
cd frontend
```

**Then choose ONE of these options:**

**Option 1 - Python (if you have it):**
```powershell
python -m http.server 5500
```

**Option 2 - Node.js http-server:**
```powershell
npx http-server -p 5500
```

**Option 3 - Just open the file:**
```powershell
start index.html
```

---

### Step 6: Use Your App! 🎬

Open your browser and go to:
- **http://localhost:5500** (if using server)
- Or just the file that opened in your browser

**Try it out:**
1. Click "Sign Up" and create an account
2. Login with your credentials
3. Start adding movies!

---

## 🎯 Current Status:

### ✅ DONE (I've built these):
- Professional Netflix-themed frontend
- Complete backend API with authentication
- Database models for users and movies
- Security features (JWT, password hashing, rate limiting)
- API integration layer
- Full documentation

### 🔧 READY TO CONNECT:
The frontend currently uses localStorage (demo mode).
**Next step:** Connect frontend to backend API.

Would you like me to:
1. **Update the frontend to use the backend API?** ← Do this next!
2. Add more features (search, movie posters, etc.)?
3. Help with deployment?

---

## 📞 Need Help?

### Backend won't start?
- Make sure you ran `npm install`
- Check your `.env` file settings
- Make sure MongoDB is accessible

### Can't connect to MongoDB?
- If using Atlas: Check your connection string
- If using local: Make sure MongoDB service is running

### Port already in use?
- Change `PORT=5001` in your `.env` file

---

## 🎬 What's Next?

**I recommend:** Let me connect the frontend to the backend API so you can:
- Have real user accounts
- Store data in the database
- Have secure authentication
- Access your movies from anywhere

**Just say:** "Connect the frontend to backend" or "Update the frontend to use the API"

**You're doing great! Almost there! 🚀**
